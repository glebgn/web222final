    <h3>Responsive design is the term used in web developing that suggest that the product is supposed to
        work and look good on any kind of screen/device, any platform and any orientation and supposed to be efficient.
        On practice, what is developers do is they use CSS the way web page becomes flexible and adjusts itself to a different screen
        than is was launched while developed.</h3>

    <h3>In our everyday life we use multiple devices all the time. Some of them are phones, some are laptops, sometimes we use computers
        or tablets. Not only some screens are bigger of have higher resolution, they also have different aspect ratios. For instance,
        most of  modern PC screens run 16:9, some older PC screen support 4:3, phones can use 5:9. Which means that layouts of the web pages
        should look absolutely different just because some screens are wider and can fit more, and some are actually small. But we can see
        all the web pages we need properly on all our devices and look quite same. The key for it - is web developers adjust everything on the site 
        for us before finishing the developing. That's why Responsive design is necessary for web development
    </h3>

    <h3>In my work I was mostly trying to use relative positioning so that elements are showed relatively of each other and one couldn't
        override another. Building web pages for different devices i learned that i need to test my sites of different screen sizes and 
        aspect ratios and make sure they look the same way or close, or at least can perform the same tasks. I learned that phones need 
        absolutely different layout that PC's and that complicates the task of wring a web page a lot.
